<!--
An HTML document is comprised of **elements**, commonly represented in one of the following ways:
   (b) <tag>body</tag> (an opening tag, content, and a closing tag),
   (b) <tag/> (an empty, self-closing tag),
   (c) <tag attribute(s)> (an empty, implicity-closed tag with attributes),
   (d) <tag attribute(s)/> (a self-closing tag with attributes),
   (e) <tag attribute(s)></tag>, (an empty tag with attributes)
   (f) <tag attribute(s)>body</tag> (an opening tag with attributes, content, and a closing tag)
A <tag> is used to initialize an element, attributes are used to modify how an element functions,
  and the content between an opening <tag> and closing </tag> specify an element's body.

<!-- This tag tells your browser to follow the official HTML spec as best as it can. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The <head> element represents your document's **metadata**, which you can specify with any number of
         <meta>, <title>, <script>, <base>, <link>, <style> tags. We'll demo the first three for now. -->
<head>
  <!-- This tag tells the browser that our document is written in English. -->
  <meta lang="en" />
  <!--
  We need to ensure two things before we write any JavaScript:
     (a) that the HTML is linked to our JS with a <script> tag (best as a child of <head>).
     (b) that we wait for our site to load before we try to manipulate it, by either:
              (i) adding the 'defer' keyword to <script>.
              (ii) running our code after the event "DOMContentLoaded" fires on `document`.
              (iii) running our code after the event "load" fires on `document`.
  Option (a)(ii) fires after the DOM loads, and Option (a)(iii) fires after the DOM, CSS, and images load.
  We recommend you go with Option (a)(i), because it lets you write top-level code in JS.
  That's the option I went with here, which is why I can start manipulating right away in `index.js`.
