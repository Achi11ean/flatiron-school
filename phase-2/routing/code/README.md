# Example Project: Sakib's Tea House
Welcome to my tea house! Browse and add to my collection with the help of components, props, state, forms, routes, and styling.

## Getting Started
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Once that's out of the way, open up `frontend/src/index.js` to learn more!
